                <p>

                <p>
                    Broadly speaking, <a href="#projects" class="internal-link">my projects</a> are primarily focused on providing opportunities for capable young mathematicians, encouraging their enthusiasm and supporting them in reaching their full potential.

                I also <a href="#speaking" class="internal-link">give talks in schools</a>, <a href="#puzzles" class="internal-link">publish maths puzzles</a> and use my background in AI to build EdTech products.

                    Speaking to young people about maths is one of my great joys in life. I loved the five years I spent as a classroom teacher; now, when I deliver talks, I understand what a privilege it is to be able to speak to students about maths, unconstrained by the requirements of the curriculum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have written and delivered talks on a range of topics including AI and Game Theory, plus my favourite, "Seeing Statistics", in which I present examples of distributions that we can observe in the physical world. I have also spoken in schools about my own personal story, sharing experiences and lessons from my own life.
                </p>

                    We all love puzzles that are in the 'Goldilocks zone' - not too easy, not too hard. Solving a tricky puzzle through effort and insight delivers a feeling of joy and satisfaction few other pastimes can match.

                <p>
                    Writing maths puzzles, then, is an art as much as a science. I have contributed problems to the i newspaper and the Guardian website, as well as running both the King's Maths School and 1729 Maths School Problem of the Week pages.

                    I completed my PhD at the University of Warwick under the supervision of Juergen Branke and Giovanni Montana. My research was in the field of Artificial Intelligence, with a particular focus on Reinforcement Learning, exploring new methods for learning in environments with states that are represented as graphs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My thesis was titled <a href="https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/id/eprint/186572/" target="_blank" class="thesis-link">Generating heuristics for graph-based problems using reinforcement learning</a>. At the time, integrating graph neural networks with reinforcement learning was a new idea. In my research I developed frameworks and algorithms that demonstrated how these methods could be combined to tackle challenging optimisation problems.

                    As well as maths I love sports. I run, I ski and I used to play rugby, with varying levels of success.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2009 I suffered a ski accident that left me unable to stand for three months, after which I had to re-learn how to walk. I suffered 14 broken bones but count myself extremely lucky to have survived.
                </p>
                <!-- <p>
                    I was told it would take two years to recover but, being young and stubborn, I chose not to accept that and signed up for an Ironman triathlon, which I completed 17 months after the accident.
                </p> -->
                <p>
                    I have spoken in schools about this experience, encouraging students to see beyond the constraints of their circumstances and demonstrating that with the right mindset, they can achieve more than they might even imagine.
